1. Index: An index in Elasticsearch is a collection of documents that share a similar structure. It's used to store, search, and retrieve data efficiently.

    - Advantages: Enables organization and categorization of data. Provides a schema to define how data should be stored and indexed. Allows for efficient data retrieval through distributed searching.
    - Disadvantages: Creating too many indices can lead to overhead and complexity. Managing a large number of indices may require careful design and resource allocation.
    - Use Cases: Storing user profiles in a social networking application. Indexing products in an e-commerce website. Storing logs and events for monitoring and analysis.
    - Implementation Example: 

            curl -X PUT "https://<elastic-url>:<port>/<index-name>" -u "username:password"

            curl -X PUT "http://localhost:9200/products" -u "username:password"

2. Mapping: A mapping defines how documents are stored and indexed within an index, including data types, analysis settings, and more.

    - Advantages: Controls how text is analyzed and indexed for search. Defines the structure of the data to ensure consistency. Provides control over field-specific settings.
    - Disadvantages: Poorly defined mappings can lead to inefficient queries or storage. Changing mappings can be complex, often requiring index reindexing.
    - Use Cases: Defining custom analyzers for different languages in a multi-language search application. Specifying date formats and time zones for date fields. Mapping keywords for faceted search in an e-commerce platform.
    - Implementation Example:


            curl -X POST "https://<elastic-url>:<port>/<index-name>" -u "username:password" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{
            "mappings": {
                "properties": {
                "unique_key_name": { "type": "data_type" },
                "unique_key_name": { "type": "data_type" },
                "unique_key_name": { "type": "data_type" },
                }
            }
            }'

            curl -X PUT "http://localhost:9200/products" -u "username:password" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{
            "mappings": {
                "properties": {
                "name": { "type": "text" },
                "price": { "type": "float" },
                "description": { "type": "text" }
                }
            }
            }'

3. Document: A document is a JSON-formatted data object that represents a single piece of data within an index.

    - Advantages: Provides a granular unit of data storage and retrieval. Supports flexible schema-less data storage. Enables efficient querying and searching.
    - Disadvantages: Large documents can impact performance and memory usage. Inflexible schema can lead to inconsistent data quality if not managed properly.
    - Use Cases: Storing user reviews in a product review application. Saving customer orders in an e-commerce system. Storing log entries in a logging system.
    - Implementation Example:

          curl -X POST "https://<elastic-url>:<port>/<index-name>/_doc/<doc-id>" -u "username:password" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{ 
                "key1": "val1", 
                "key2": val2, 
                "keyN": "valN"
                }'

          curl -X POST "http://localhost:9200/products/_doc/1" -u "username:password" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{
            "name": "Smartphone",
            "price": 499.99,
            "description": "High-end smartphone with advanced features."
            }'


4. Query DSL: Query DSL (Domain-Specific Language) is a JSON-based language used to construct various types of queries for searching and retrieving documents.

    - Advantages: Offers fine-grained control over search behavior. Supports complex queries with boolean logic, filters, and aggregations. Enables relevance-based searching with features like boosting.
    - Disadvantages: Writing complex queries might require a learning curve. Overuse of complex queries can impact performance.
    - Use Cases: Implementing a search bar in an e-commerce platform. Filtering and aggregating log data for monitoring. Implementing personalized recommendations based on user behavior.
    - Implementation Example:

          curl -X POST "https://<elastic-url>:<port>/<index-name>/_search" -u "username:password" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{
            "query": {
                "match": {
                "key_name": "value"
                }
            }
            }'

          curl -X GET "http://localhost:9200/products/_search" -u "username:password" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{
            "query": {
                "match": {
                "description": "smartphone"
                }
            }
            }'
        

5. Analyzer: An analyzer processes and transforms text during indexing and searching, breaking it into terms and applying transformations for better search accuracy.

    - Advantages: Tokenizes and normalizes text for consistent searching. Handles stemming, stop words, and other language-specific aspects. Improves search quality by allowing more flexible queries.
    - Disadvantages: Incorrect analyzer settings can lead to unexpected search results. Custom analyzers may require careful design and testing.
    - Use Cases: Enabling full-text search in a blog platform. Analyzing user-generated content for sentiment analysis. Tokenizing and processing product descriptions for e-commerce search.
    - Implementation Example:

          curl -X PUT "http://localhost:9200/products" -u "username:password" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{
                "settings": {
                    "analysis": {
                    "analyzer": {
                        "custom_analyzer": {
                        "tokenizer": "whitespace",
                        "filter": ["lowercase"]
                        }
                    }
                    }
                },
                "mappings": {
                    "properties": {
                    "name": {
                        "type": "text",
                        "analyzer": "custom_analyzer"
                    }
                    }
                }
                }'
