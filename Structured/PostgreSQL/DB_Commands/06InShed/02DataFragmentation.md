In PostgreSQL, VACUUM is a crucial maintenance operation used to reclaim storage space and improve the performance of the database by removing dead or obsolete rows and updating statistics. As data is inserted, updated, and deleted in a PostgreSQL database, dead rows (also known as "dead tuples") can accumulate over time, leading to wasted space and potentially slowing down query performance. The VACUUM operation addresses this by cleaning up the dead rows and updating relevant metadata.

#### AUTO
----------
Autovacuum Configuration: PostgreSQL has an autovacuum system that automatically manages the VACUUM process. You can configure the autovacuum behavior using the following configuration parameters in the postgresql.conf file:

- autovacuum: This parameter enables or disables the autovacuum process as a whole. Set it to on to enable autovacuum and off to disable it. The default is on.
- autovacuum_vacuum_scale_factor: This parameter controls when autovacuum should be triggered based on the number of updated or deleted rows relative to the table size.
- autovacuum_vacuum_threshold: This parameter sets the minimum number of updated or deleted rows to trigger autovacuum.
- autovacuum_analyze_scale_factor: Similar to autovacuum_vacuum_scale_factor, but for triggering the ANALYZE process.
- autovacuum_analyze_threshold: Similar to autovacuum_vacuum_threshold, but for triggering the ANALYZE process.

Disable Autovacuum for Specific Tables: If you want to prevent autovacuum from running on specific tables, you can set the autovacuum_enabled parameter for those tables to false using the ALTER TABLE command:

        ALTER TABLE table_name SET (autovacuum_enabled = false); // To disable
        ALTER TABLE table_name SET (autovacuum_enabled = true);  // To enable

Advantages of VACUUM:
- Reclaims Space: VACUUM frees up storage space by removing dead rows from tables and indexes.
- Improves Performance: Removing dead rows and updating statistics helps optimize query planning and execution, leading to better performance.
- Prevents Bloat: Regular VACUUM prevents table and index bloat, which can lead to degraded performance and increased storage requirements.
- Maintains Data Integrity: VACUUM ensures that deleted or outdated data is safely removed, preventing inconsistencies.

Use Cases:
- Data Maintenance: Regularly running VACUUM is essential for maintaining optimal database performance by preventing excessive storage usage and ensuring up-to-date statistics.
- Table Updates: After performing a significant number of updates or deletes on a table, running VACUUM can help recover space and improve query performance.
- Transactional Workloads: Databases with frequent insert, update, and delete operations benefit from regular VACUUM operations to manage space and maintain performance.

Dependency: VACUUM operations are not dependent on other operations. However, it's crucial to ensure that there is enough disk space available for VACUUM to operate successfully, as it requires space to create temporary files during the process.

Running VACUUM: Performs a VACUUM operation and also updates the statistics of the tables and indexes and provides detailed information about the VACUUM operation's progress and actions taken.

    To run VACUUM on a specific tablespace(will be run on all tables and indexes within the specified tablespace):

            VACUUM (VERBOSE, ANALYZE) TABLESPACE tablespace_name;

    VACUUM (no options): Performs a basic VACUUM operation on all tables and indexes in the current database.

            VACUUM;

    VACUUM FULL: Reclaims more space by compacting tables and indexes. However, it requires an exclusive lock on the table and can be more resource-intensive.

            VACUUM FULL;

    Running VACUUM on all database objects within the DB:

        VACUUM (VERBOSE, ANALYZE);

Running VACUUM on Partitioned Tables: When you have partitioned tables, you can run VACUUM on individual partitions or on the entire partitioned table. Here's how to do it:

    To run VACUUM on a specific partition of a partitioned table:

        VACUUM (VERBOSE, ANALYZE) table_name
        PARTITION partition_name;

    To run VACUUM on the entire partitioned table:

        VACUUM (VERBOSE, ANALYZE) table_name;

Remember to include the ANALYZE option to also update statistics, which helps the query planner make more informed decisions.

Note: VACUUM operations can be resource-intensive, especially for larger databases. It's important to schedule these operations during maintenance windows or periods of lower database activity. Also, consider using the VERBOSE option to get detailed progress information during the VACUUM process.

As of PostgreSQL 13, you can also use the pg_stat_progress_vacuum view to monitor the progress of ongoing VACUUM operations in real-time. This view provides information about the number of tuples processed, pages scanned, and more.
