## Multiversion Concurrency Control (MVCC) in PostgreSQL
---------------------------------------------------------

Definition and Functionality: MVCC is a technique used in DBMS, including PostgreSQL, to allow multiple transactions to access and modify data simultaneously without conflicting with each other. MVCC maintains multiple versions of data, allowing transactions to read consistent data snapshots while still maintaining isolation and ensuring data integrity.

How MVCC Works: In MVCC, each transaction works with its own snapshot of the data. When a transaction starts, it sees a consistent snapshot of the database as it existed at the start of the transaction. This snapshot remains unchanged throughout the transaction's execution, even if other transactions are modifying the data concurrently. When a transaction commits, only its changes become visible to other transactions.

- Advantages of MVCC:
    - Concurrent Access: MVCC allows multiple transactions to read and write data concurrently without blocking each other, improving system throughput and responsiveness.
    - Isolation: Transactions operate in isolation from each other, preventing interference and ensuring data integrity.
    - Consistency: Each transaction sees a consistent snapshot of the data, even in the presence of concurrent modifications by other transactions.
    - No Locking Delays: MVCC significantly reduces the need for locking and associated delays, as transactions can work with their own snapshots without blocking others.

- Disadvantages of MVCC:
    - Storage Overhead: MVCC requires maintaining multiple versions of data, which can lead to increased storage usage.
    - Complexity: Implementing MVCC requires complex mechanisms to manage multiple data versions and ensure consistency.

- Use Cases: MVCC is particularly useful in scenarios where high concurrency is essential, 
    - Online Transaction Processing (OLTP) Systems: Systems with numerous concurrent users performing various operations on the database benefit from MVCC to avoid locking bottlenecks.
    - Read-Intensive Applications: In applications where read operations significantly outnumber write operations, MVCC reduces contention between readers and writers.

- Dependency: MVCC heavily depends on the transaction log, which stores all changes made to the database. This log is crucial for reconstructing data snapshots for different transactions.


Phenomena that can occur when multiple transactions are interacting in a concurrent database environment, especially when different isolation levels are used. Let's delve into each of these and understand their scenarios:

- Dirty Reads: A dirty read happens when one transaction reads uncommitted changes made by another transaction. In other words, a transaction reads data that has been modified by another transaction but not yet committed. This can lead to incorrect or inconsistent data being read.
    - Scenario:
        - Transaction A updates a row.
        - Transaction B reads the updated row before Transaction A commits.
        - If Transaction A rolls back, Transaction B has read data that never actually existed.

- Non-Repeatable Reads: A non-repeatable read occurs when a transaction reads the same data twice, but the data has changed between the two reads due to another committed transaction. This can lead to unexpected results as the data viewed by the transaction is inconsistent.
    - Scenario:
        - Transaction A reads a row.
        - Transaction B updates the same row and commits.
        - Transaction A reads the same row again and finds different data from the first read.

- Phantom Reads: A phantom read happens when a transaction retrieves a set of rows based on a certain condition, but between two reads, another transaction inserts, updates, or deletes rows that meet that condition. This can lead to changes in the data set between the two reads, causing unexpected results.
    - Scenario:
        - Transaction A executes a query that retrieves rows meeting a certain condition.
        - Transaction B inserts a new row that meets the same condition and commits.
        - Transaction A executes the same query again and finds the new row inserted by Transaction B.

- Lost Updates: A lost update occurs when two transactions try to update the same data concurrently, and one of the updates is overwritten by the other, resulting in the first update being lost. This can lead to data inconsistencies and incorrect results.
    - Scenario:
        - Transaction A and Transaction B both read the same row.
        - Transaction A updates the row and commits.
        - Transaction B updates the same row without knowledge of Transaction A's update and commits, effectively overwriting Transaction A's change.

- Serialization Anomalies: Serialization anomalies occur when the order of operations in concurrent transactions leads to unexpected results. There are three types of serialization anomalies: Dirty Write, Uncommitted Dependency, and Inconsistent Analysis.

    - Dirty Write: One transaction overwrites the changes made by another transaction that has not been committed yet.
        - Scenario (Dirty Write):
            - Transaction A and Transaction B both read the same row.
            - Transaction A updates the row and commits.
            - Transaction B updates the same row and commits, overwriting Transaction A's update.

    - Uncommitted Dependency: A transaction reads the changes made by another transaction that hasn't been committed, leading to non-repeatable reads.
        - Scenario (Uncommitted Dependency):
            - Transaction A updates a row but doesn't commit.
            - Transaction B reads the row updated by Transaction A and commits.
            - Transaction A rolls back, leading to Transaction B having data that never existed.

    - Inconsistent Analysis: A transaction reads different states of the database in the same query, leading to incorrect results.
        - Scenario (Inconsistent Analysis):
            - Transaction A reads a set of rows.
            - Transaction B updates and commits some of the rows read by Transaction A.
            - Transaction A reads the same set of rows again and gets inconsistent data.    

To address these phenomena, PostgreSQL provides different isolation levels that control the level of data visibility and interactions between transactions. Carefully choosing the appropriate isolation level is crucial to maintain data consistency, prevent unexpected behaviors, and ensure the accuracy of query results. It's essential to understand these phenomena and the isolation levels to design robust and reliable database transactions for your application.

The occurrence of these phenomena depends on the isolation level set for transactions:

1. START TRANSACTION: This command is used to begin a new transaction. Transactions are used to group one or more SQL statements into a single logical unit of work. This allows you to maintain data integrity, consistency, and isolation while performing multiple operations.
2. ISOLATION LEVEL: Isolation levels define how transactions interact with each other in a multi-user environment. There are different isolation levels, each offering a different level of consistency and concurrency. The isolation levels in PostgreSQL are:

    - READ UNCOMMITTED:
        - Functionality: Transactions at this level can see uncommitted changes made by other transactions. This provides the highest degree of concurrency but sacrifices data consistency.
        - Advantages: Maximum concurrency, as transactions are not blocked by locks.
        - Disadvantages: Low data consistency, increased likelihood of dirty reads, non-repeatable reads, and phantom reads.
        - Use Cases: Rarely used due to its high inconsistency. Suitable only when high concurrency is essential and data accuracy can be compromised.

                BEGIN;
                SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL READ UNCOMMITTED;

    - READ COMMITTED:
        - Functionality: Transactions can only see changes committed by other transactions. This level provides better consistency compared to READ UNCOMMITTED.
        - Advantages: Improved data consistency while maintaining a reasonable degree of concurrency.
        - Disadvantages: Dirty reads are avoided, but non-repeatable reads and phantom reads can still occur.
        - Use Cases: A common choice for applications requiring a balance between data consistency and concurrency, where dirty reads are not acceptable.

                BEGIN;
                SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL READ COMMITTED;

    - REPEATABLE READ:
        - Functionality: Transactions see a consistent snapshot of the data throughout the transaction, even if other transactions are making changes. Certain anomalies like "phantom reads" are prevented.
        - Advantages: Higher data consistency, protects against certain concurrency anomalies.
        - Disadvantages: Dirty reads and non-repeatable reads are avoided, but phantom reads can still occur.
        - Use Cases: Useful when maintaining consistent data views is crucial, as in financial transactions or reporting scenarios.
        - Dependencies: Requires proper index usage to minimize locking overhead

                BEGIN;
                SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL REPEATABLE READ;

    - SERIALIZABLE:
        - Functionality: Transactions are completely isolated from each other, ensuring the highest degree of consistency. All possible concurrency anomalies are prevented.
        - Advantages: Highest data consistency and protection against all concurrency anomalies.
        - Disadvantages: Dirty reads, non-repeatable reads, and phantom reads are prevented, but this level often comes with performance implications due to locking.
        - Use Cases: Critical applications where data accuracy and integrity are paramount, such as accounting systems or sensitive financial transactions.
        - Dependencies: Requires careful design to minimize deadlock risks and proper query optimization.

                BEGIN;
                SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL SERIALIZABLE;

Multiversion Concurrency Control is a fundamental aspect of PostgreSQL's transaction management, enabling high concurrency and maintaining data consistency. It is a key feature that allows PostgreSQL to efficiently handle complex multi-user scenarios while ensuring data integrity.

Example 1:

1. Create a Sample Table: Let's create a sample table named orders to simulate an e-commerce database.

        CREATE TABLE orders (
            order_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
            product_name VARCHAR(100),
            order_date TIMESTAMP,
            status VARCHAR(20)
        );

2. Insert Initial Data: Insert some initial data into the orders table.

        INSERT INTO orders (product_name, order_date, status)
        VALUES ('Product A', '2023-07-01', 'pending'),
            ('Product B', '2023-07-02', 'processing'),
            ('Product C', '2023-07-03', 'shipped');

3. Simulate Transactions: Let's simulate two transactions concurrently, one reading data and another updating data.

    - Transaction 1 -> Reading Data

            START TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL REPEATABLE READ;
            SELECT * FROM orders WHERE status = 'processing';
            COMMIT;

    - Transaction 2 -> Updating Data

            START TRANSACTION;
            UPDATE orders SET status = 'delivered' WHERE order_date = '2023-07-02';
            COMMIT;

In this scenario, Transaction 1 starts with the REPEATABLE READ isolation level, which means it will see a consistent snapshot of the data throughout the transaction. Transaction 2 updates data concurrently.

Because of MVCC, Transaction 1 sees the orders table as it was at the start of the transaction, regardless of any changes made by Transaction 2. This ensures that Transaction 1 doesn't see the update made by Transaction 2 until it commits.

Check Results:
After both transactions have been completed, you can check the results.

        SELECT * FROM orders;

The output will show that the status of 'Product B' is still 'processing' for Transaction 1, even though Transaction 2 updated it to 'delivered'. This demonstrates the consistent snapshot seen by Transaction 1 due to MVCC.

Keep in mind that the actual output might vary based on the order of execution and timing. MVCC ensures that each transaction sees a consistent snapshot while maintaining concurrency and data integrity.

In this example, we've implemented MVCC using PSQL commands to showcase how it allows concurrent transactions to work with consistent data snapshots. This capability is integral to PostgreSQL's efficient handling of concurrent access and maintaining data consistency in a multi-user environment.

Example 2: Let's consider a scenario where we have a bank database with two concurrent transactions attempting to update an account balance:

Transaction A: Updates account balance to $500.
Transaction B: Updates the same account balance to $600.
Using READ COMMITTED isolation, Transaction B can see the changes made by Transaction A and might overwrite them. This is a lost update scenario.

        -- Transaction A
        BEGIN;
        UPDATE accounts SET balance = 500 WHERE account_id = 123;
        COMMIT;

        -- Transaction B
        BEGIN;
        UPDATE accounts SET balance = 600 WHERE account_id = 123;
        COMMIT;

To prevent this, we can use a higher isolation level, like SERIALIZABLE:


        -- Transaction A
        BEGIN TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL SERIALIZABLE;
        UPDATE accounts SET balance = 500 WHERE account_id = 123;
        COMMIT;

        -- Transaction B
        BEGIN TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL SERIALIZABLE;
        UPDATE accounts SET balance = 600 WHERE account_id = 123; -- Will wait for Transaction A to complete
        COMMIT;

In this example, Transaction B waits for Transaction A to complete before proceeding, preventing lost updates.

Selecting the appropriate isolation level depends on the application's requirements, concurrency needs, and trade-offs between data consistency and performance. It's crucial to understand these isolation levels and their implications to design robust and reliable database systems.
