### Basic SELECT

- Get the count of all the Rows in DB

        # SELECT count(*) FROM <DB-Name>
        # SELECT * FROM ONLY <Schema-Name>.<Table-Name>; // Used to get Parent Table Data
        # SELECT count(*) FROM inventory.products ;

### WHERE Clause:

- Functionality: The WHERE clause is used to filter rows based on specified conditions. It allows you to retrieve only the rows that meet the given criteria.
- Get particular columns and WHERE with AND/OR augumentation and wild card 
- Use Cases: Use the WHERE clause when you want to fetch specific rows that satisfy certain conditions.
- Parameters:
    - Columns (table fields): They are used to compare data within the table.
    - Constants (literal values): They are used as fixed values in comparisons.
- Operators:
    - Comparison Operators: =, <> (not equal), <, >, <=, >=
    - Logical Operators: AND, OR, NOT
    - IN Operator: Used to specify a list of values to compare against.
    - BETWEEN Operator: Used to specify a range of values.
            
            # SELECT col1, col2, col3 
            FROM <DB-Name> 
            WHERE colN LIKE 'Se%' 
            [OR|AND] colM='SearchValue' ; 

            # SELECT column1, column2, ...
            FROM table_name
            WHERE condition;
            
        Example: Let's say we have a "products" table, and we want to fetch products with a price greater than $50.
            
            SELECT product_id, product_name, price
            FROM products
            WHERE price > 50.0;

### GROUP BY Clause:

- Functionality: The GROUP BY clause is used to group rows based on specified columns. It allows you to apply aggregate functions on groups of rows.
- Use Cases: Use the GROUP BY clause when you want to group rows based on one or more columns and perform calculations on each group using aggregate functions.
- Parameters: Columns (table fields): They are used to group rows based on specific column values.
- Operators: No operators directly, but it helps in creating groups for aggregate functions.

            SELECT column1, column2, ..., aggregate_function(column)
            FROM table_name
            GROUP BY column1, column2, ...;

        Example: Let's say we have an "orders" table, and we want to calculate the total value of orders for each customer.

            SELECT customer_id, SUM(order_total) AS total_amount
            FROM orders
            GROUP BY customer_id;


### HAVING Clause:

- Functionality: The HAVING clause is used to filter rows after applying a GROUP BY clause. It allows you to filter groups of rows based on aggregate functions.
- Use Cases: Use the HAVING clause when you want to filter groups of rows generated by the GROUP BY clause based on certain conditions.
- Parameters: Aggregate Functions: Such as SUM(), COUNT(), AVG(), MAX(), MIN(), etc. They operate on groups of rows generated by the GROUP BY clause.
- Operators: Comparison Operators: =, <, >, <=, >=, <> (not equal)

            SELECT column1, column2, ..., aggregate_function(column)
            FROM table_name
            GROUP BY column1, column2, ...
            HAVING condition;

        Example: Let's say we have an "orders" table, and we want to find customers who have placed orders with a total value greater than $500.

            SELECT customer_id, SUM(order_total) AS total_amount
            FROM orders
            GROUP BY customer_id
            HAVING SUM(order_total) > 500.0;

### ORDER BY Clause:

- Functionality: The ORDER BY clause is used to sort the result set based on one or more columns. It allows you to control the order in which the rows are displayed.
- Use Cases: Use the ORDER BY clause when you want to sort the result set based on specific column values, either in ascending or descending order.
- Parameters: Columns (table fields): They are used to specify the columns for sorting the result set.
- Operators:
    - ASC: Sorts the result set in ascending order (default).
    - DESC: Sorts the result set in descending order.

            SELECT column1, column2, ...
            FROM table_name
            ORDER BY column1 [ASC | DESC], column2 [ASC | DESC], ...;
            
        Example: Let's say we have a "products" table, and we want to retrieve products sorted by price in descending order.

            SELECT product_id, product_name, price
            FROM products
            ORDER BY price DESC;

#### LIMIT Clause:
- Functionality: The LIMIT clause is used to restrict the number of rows returned in the result set.
- Use Case: Use the LIMIT clause when you only need to retrieve a specific number of rows from the query result.

        SELECT product_name, price
        FROM products
        ORDER BY price DESC
        LIMIT 10;

#### OFFSET Clause:
-  Functionality: The OFFSET clause is used to skip a specified number of rows from the beginning of the result set.
-  Use Case: Use the OFFSET clause when you want to retrieve rows starting from a certain position in the result set.

        SELECT product_name, price
        FROM products
        ORDER BY price DESC
        LIMIT 10 OFFSET 20;

#### DISTINCT Keyword:
-  Functionality: The DISTINCT keyword is used to eliminate duplicate rows from the result set.
-  Use Case: Use the DISTINCT keyword when you want to retrieve unique values from a column.

        SELECT DISTINCT category
        FROM products;

#### JOIN Clause:
-  Functionality: The JOIN clause is used to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column between them.
-  Use Case: Use the JOIN clause when you need to fetch data from multiple tables based on common keys.

        SELECT orders.order_id, customers.customer_name
        FROM orders
        JOIN customers ON orders.customer_id = customers.customer_id;

#### LIKE Operator:
-  Functionality: The LIKE operator is used for pattern matching in string comparisons.
-  Use Case: Use the LIKE operator when you want to perform wildcard-based searches on text columns.

        SELECT product_name
        FROM products
        WHERE product_name LIKE '%chair%';

#### IN Operator:
-  Functionality: The IN operator is used to compare a value against a list of values.
-  Use Case: Use the IN operator when you want to check if a value matches any value in a specified list.

        SELECT product_name, price
        FROM products
        WHERE category IN ('Electronics', 'Furniture');

#### EXISTS Operator:
-  Functionality: The EXISTS operator is used to check if a subquery returns any rows.
-  Use Case: Use the EXISTS operator when you want to perform conditional checks based on the existence of data in a subquery.

        SELECT supplier_name
        FROM suppliers
        WHERE EXISTS (
            SELECT 1
            FROM products
            WHERE products.supplier_id = suppliers.supplier_id
        );

#### IS NULL and IS NOT NULL Operators:
-  Functionality: These operators are used to check for NULL values in columns.
-  Use Case: Use them to filter rows where a column contains NULL or non-NULL values.

        SELECT product_name
        FROM products
        WHERE category IS NULL;

#### UNION Operator:
-  Functionality: The UNION operator combines the results of two or more SELECT queries and removes duplicate rows.
-  Use Case: Use it when you want to merge results from multiple queries into a single result set.

        SELECT product_name FROM products WHERE price > 50
        UNION
        SELECT product_name FROM products WHERE stock_quantity < 50;

#### INTERSECT Operator:
-  Functionality: The INTERSECT operator returns only the rows that appear in both result sets of two or more SELECT queries.
-  Use Case: Use it when you want to find common rows between multiple queries.

        SELECT product_name FROM products WHERE price > 50
        INTERSECT
        SELECT product_name FROM products WHERE stock_quantity > 0;

#### EXCEPT Operator:
-  Functionality: The EXCEPT operator returns the rows that appear in the first result set but not in the second result set of two SELECT queries.
-  Use Case: Use it when you want to find rows that are unique to one of the queries.

        SELECT product_name FROM products WHERE category = 'Electronics'
        EXCEPT
        SELECT product_name FROM products WHERE price > 100;

#### CASE Expression:
-  Functionality: The CASE expression performs conditional logic in queries, similar to if-else constructs.
-  Use Case: Use it when you want to perform different actions based on specific conditions.

        SELECT product_name,
            CASE
                WHEN price > 100 THEN 'Expensive'
                WHEN price > 50 THEN 'Moderate'
                ELSE 'Affordable'
            END AS price_category
        FROM products;

#### COALESCE Function:
-  Functionality: The COALESCE function returns the first non-NULL value from a list of expressions.
-  Use Case: Use it when you want to handle NULL values and replace them with default values.

        SELECT product_name, COALESCE(discounted_price, price) AS final_price
        FROM products;

#### EXISTS Keyword:
-  Functionality: The EXISTS keyword is used in subqueries to check for the existence of rows.
-  Use Case: Use it when you want to perform conditional checks based on the result of a subquery.

        SELECT supplier_name
        FROM suppliers
        WHERE EXISTS (
            SELECT 1
