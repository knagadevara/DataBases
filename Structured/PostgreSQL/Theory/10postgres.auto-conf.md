postmaster.opts (Dynamically Generated Configuration):
In PostgreSQL versions 12 and later, the postmaster.opts file is a dynamically generated configuration file that contains settings modified using the ALTER SYSTEM SQL command. Unlike other static configuration files like postgresql.conf, pg_hba.conf, and others, the postmaster.opts file is generated by the PostgreSQL process itself.
Functionality:
- Dynamic Configuration: The postmaster.opts file stores the dynamically changed configuration settings that are set using the ALTER SYSTEM SQL command. These changes are applied without requiring a server restart, providing flexibility in making runtime configuration adjustments.
- Transaction Safety: Changes made using ALTER SYSTEM are transaction-safe, meaning they are only visible to the current session until a COMMIT is issued. Once committed, the changes are written to postmaster.opts and become effective for all sessions.
- Storage Location: The postmaster.opts file is usually located in the PostgreSQL data directory and is created and managed by the PostgreSQL process.
- Layout: Unlike static configuration files, the postmaster.opts file does not have a predefined layout. Instead, it contains the configuration settings that were altered using the ALTER SYSTEM SQL command. Each line in the file represents one configuration parameter and its value, separated by an equal sign (=). Comments and blank lines are not stored in the postmaster.opts file.
- Variations: As mentioned earlier, there are no variations of fields in postgresql.auto.conf (which does not exist). The configuration settings stored in the dynamically generated postmaster.opts file will vary depending on the configuration changes made using ALTER SYSTEM during runtime.
- For example, if you set the work_mem parameter using ALTER SYSTEM, it will be reflected in the postmaster.opts file as follows:

        work_mem = '64MB'

To better understand the dynamically changed settings, you can query the pg_settings view to see the current values and their source (e.g., default, configuration file, command-line, or postmaster.opts). For example:


    SELECT name, setting, source FROM pg_settings;

This query will show the name, current value, and source of each configuration parameter. Parameters sourced from postmaster.opts will be displayed as "configuration file."

In conclusion, the postmaster.opts file (replacing postgresql.auto.conf for versions 12 and later) plays a crucial role in PostgreSQL's dynamic configuration management. It allows for real-time adjustment of configuration settings without requiring a server restart, making it more flexible and efficient to handle runtime changes. It's important to understand that this file is managed by PostgreSQL internally and should not be directly edited by users. Instead, use the ALTER SYSTEM SQL command to make configuration changes safely and persistently. Always refer to the official PostgreSQL documentation and best practices for managing configuration settings to ensure the stability and performance of your PostgreSQL database.
