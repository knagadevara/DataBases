- Postgres uses "process per-user" client server model
- PostMaster is the first process to start when Postgres starts
    1. It will be then assigned a shared memory which comprises of
        - Shared buffer
        - CLOG Buffer
        - WAL Buffer
        - Work-Memory Buffer
        - Maintainence Work-Memory Buffer
        - Dead Buffer
        - Other buffers
    2. Postmaster then starts the below processes
        - Stats Collector: All the DB core system activity will be collected and reported to DB-Dictionary
        - Checkpointer
        - Wal Writer
        - Auto Vacume Launcher: Responsible to maintain fragmentation on bloated tables 
        - Logging Collector: Write all the error/info/warning logs to respected log files
        - Writer
        - Archival

- Senario if a user tried to connect to Postgres-Database(Which keeps listening for connections on port 5432)
    - User/App trys to connects to DB
        - Connections will be picked by Postmaster(PstM)
            - PstM validates the credentials, Checks if the IP is allowed.
            - ON_SUCCESS Roles assigned to connection are checked, and a new internal process is started to whcih the connection will be handover.
            - The new process will now allow the connection to connect to Shared buffer and then it can read/write
            - This connecton will be kept alive until "session is active" or "user is logged in"

- Senario if a user ran a SELECT command.
    - Data is loaded from data files into shared buffer then results are sent back to client from postgres-process

- In case of INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE
    1. Changes are made in Shared-Buffer
    2. Copy of the transaction is made to the Wall-Buffer
    3. On-Commit Wal-Buffer calls Wal-Writer process which writes to Wal-Files on Disk.
    4. Data at this point in Shared buffer will be marked as commited.
    5. Checkpointer(defaultly invoked every 5 min, checks if there is any data that needs to be synced between SharedBuffer and DataFiles on Disk) signals the Writer
    6. Writer writes all the dirty-buffer-data(data in memory which is not yet written to data files on disk) on shared-buffer to data-files on disk
    7. If in any case the Wal-Files are full then Archival-Process will copy the buffer-data-dump(uncommited data) to Archival-Files and Log it. It will also play an important role to do a point-in-time revocery. 
    8. CLOG-Buffer(Commit-Log Buffer) All commited transactions are marked in this buffer -> in any case of crash/reboot, this buffer will be checked to employ a restore.

        CREATE DATABASE library;

In PostgreSQL, several crucial components and background processes work together to ensure the proper functioning, stability, and performance of the database management system. Let's explore these components and processes in detail:

PostgreSQL Server Process (Backend Process):
The PostgreSQL server process, often referred to as the "backend process," is the main process that handles client connections and executes queries on behalf of connected clients. Each client connection is managed by a separate backend process. When a client sends a query to the server, the backend process parses and processes the query, interacts with the storage engine, and returns the query results to the client.
Example:
When a user connects to the PostgreSQL database using a client application (e.g., psql), a backend process is created to handle the communication with that client. The backend process executes queries and transactions on behalf of that client, managing the client's session throughout its lifetime.

Shared Buffer:
The shared buffer is a critical component of PostgreSQL's memory management system. It serves as a cache, storing frequently accessed data pages from the disk to improve query performance. When a query needs to read data, PostgreSQL first checks if the required data is available in the shared buffer. If it is found (a "cache hit"), the data is retrieved quickly from memory. Otherwise, PostgreSQL fetches the data from the disk (a "cache miss") and stores it in the shared buffer for future access.
Example:
When a client executes a query that involves reading data from a table, PostgreSQL checks if the required data pages are already present in the shared buffer. If they are, the data can be fetched from memory, avoiding the need to read from the disk, resulting in faster query execution.

Background Writer (bgwriter):
The Background Writer (bgwriter) is a background process responsible for managing the shared buffer. Its primary function is to write ("flush") dirty buffers from the shared buffer to the disk. A "dirty buffer" is a data page that has been modified in memory but not yet written back to the disk. The bgwriter helps keep the shared buffer clean by flushing dirty buffers in the background.
Example:
When a client updates or inserts data into a table, the corresponding data pages become dirty (modified) in the shared buffer. The bgwriter periodically flushes these dirty buffers to the disk, ensuring that changes made to the database are safely persisted.

Write-Ahead Log (WAL) Writer:
The Write-Ahead Log (WAL) Writer is another critical background process in PostgreSQL. It handles the Write-Ahead Log, a sequential log file separate from the main data files. Whenever a transaction makes changes to the database, the changes are first written to the WAL before being applied to the actual data files.
Example:
Suppose a client executes a transaction that involves updating multiple rows in a table. Before these changes are applied to the table's data files, PostgreSQL writes a record of the changes to the WAL. This ensures that if a crash or failure occurs before the changes are written to the disk, PostgreSQL can use the WAL to replay the changes during crash recovery, bringing the database back to a consistent state.

Autovacuum Cleaner:
The Autovacuum Cleaner is a background process responsible for automatically performing the vacuuming process. Vacuuming is essential for reclaiming space and removing dead rows from tables and indexes. As data is modified or deleted, dead rows accumulate, and vacuuming helps to keep the tables and indexes in optimal shape.
Example:
When a table has been heavily modified or has a significant number of deleted rows, it can suffer from table bloat, consuming more disk space than necessary. The Autovacuum Cleaner periodically checks for such situations and performs vacuuming to reclaim space and maintain efficient storage usage.

Checkpointer:
The Checkpointer is another background process responsible for writing dirty buffers from the shared buffer to the disk. Its primary role is to ensure a balance between the need to keep frequently accessed data in the buffer (to improve performance) and the need to free up space for new data. By periodically flushing dirty buffers to disk, the Checkpointer helps maintain stability and performance.
Example:
As the shared buffer fills up with dirty buffers due to modifications to data, the Checkpointer periodically writes these dirty buffers to the disk, ensuring that data is safely persisted and making room for new data in the buffer.

WAL Archiver:
The WAL Archiver is responsible for archiving the Write-Ahead Log files. Archiving is essential for creating backup copies of the WAL files, allowing for point-in-time recovery and replication to standby servers.
Example:
If archiving is enabled, the WAL Archiver continuously copies the filled WAL files to a designated archive location. These archived WAL files can be used for crash recovery or to keep standby servers in sync with the primary server.

In conclusion, PostgreSQL's crucial components and background processes work together to ensure data integrity, stability, and performance. The PostgreSQL server process handles client connections and query execution. The shared buffer serves as a cache to improve query performance. The bgwriter and the WAL Writer manage data persistence and durability. The Autovacuum Cleaner and Checkpointer help maintain efficient storage and stability. Understanding  these components and background processes is essential for efficiently managing and optimizing a PostgreSQL database. Additionally, several other components contribute to PostgreSQL's functionality and performance:

Lock Manager:
The Lock Manager in PostgreSQL is responsible for managing concurrency control and ensuring data consistency in multi-user environments. It handles various types of locks (e.g., shared locks, exclusive locks) to prevent conflicting operations on the same data by different transactions.
Example:
When multiple clients concurrently attempt to update the same row in a table, the Lock Manager ensures that only one transaction can acquire an exclusive lock on the row at a time. Other transactions requesting an exclusive lock on the same row will be queued until the lock is released.

Query Planner and Executor:
The Query Planner analyzes incoming queries and generates an efficient execution plan. It determines the most suitable indexes to use, joins methods, and sort algorithms to optimize query performance. The Query Executor then executes the generated plan and retrieves query results.
Example:
When a client submits a complex SQL query, the Query Planner examines the available indexes and statistics to create a query plan that minimizes the number of disk reads and maximizes the use of cached data, resulting in faster query execution.

Transaction Manager:
The Transaction Manager ensures that database transactions follow the ACID properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability). It manages the beginning, committing, and rollback of transactions.
Example:
When a client executes a series of SQL statements within a transaction block, the Transaction Manager ensures that either all the statements within the block are executed successfully (atomicity), or none of them are executed (rollback) in case of an error.

Connection Pooler:
In multi-user environments, the Connection Pooler efficiently manages and reuses database connections to minimize the overhead of establishing new connections for each client. It helps improve database performance by reducing connection overhead.
Example:
In a web application with multiple concurrent users, the Connection Pooler maintains a pool of established database connections. When a client requests a connection, the pooler provides an available connection from the pool rather than creating a new one, reducing connection establishment overhead.

Background Tasks Scheduler:
PostgreSQL allows users to schedule background tasks using the pg_cron extension or other third-party tools. These tasks can be used for various purposes, such as data backups, data exports, and automated maintenance.
Example:
A database administrator can use the background tasks scheduler to create a cron job that performs a daily backup of critical databases, ensuring data recovery options in case of data loss or hardware failure.

In summary, PostgreSQL's crucial components and background processes, along with various other components, collectively form a robust and powerful database management system. Each component plays a specific role in maintaining data consistency, durability, and performance, making PostgreSQL a popular choice for both small-scale applications and large, enterprise-level systems. Understanding the functionalities of these components is essential for effective database management and optimization.

Extensions:
PostgreSQL allows the integration of third-party extensions that extend the functionality of the database. Extensions can introduce new data types, operators, functions, and other features, enriching the database's capabilities without modifying the core system.
Example:
The pgcrypto extension provides cryptographic functions and features, allowing users to encrypt and decrypt data, generate hash values, and work with digital signatures directly within the database.

Replication Components:
PostgreSQL offers various replication options to create redundant copies of the database for high availability and disaster recovery purposes. Replication components include:
Streaming Replication: This asynchronous replication method replicates changes from the primary server (master) to one or more standby servers (replicas). It allows the standby servers to stay synchronized with the primary server and take over in case of a primary server failure.
Example:
By configuring streaming replication, a primary PostgreSQL server continuously sends WAL records to a standby server. The standby server applies these changes, ensuring it maintains an up-to-date copy of the primary database.

Logical Replication: Logical replication replicates changes at the row or statement level rather than at the block level. It provides more flexibility in replicating selected tables and columns.
Example:
Logical replication enables a PostgreSQL instance to replicate specific tables to another PostgreSQL database or even to non-PostgreSQL databases (using third-party replication solutions).

Foreign Data Wrappers (FDW):
Foreign Data Wrappers allow PostgreSQL to access data from external data sources as if they were local database tables. It enables seamless integration with other databases, file systems, web services, or non-traditional data sources.
Example:
By using the postgres_fdw FDW, a PostgreSQL database can access and query tables located in a remote PostgreSQL database as if they were part of the local database.

Procedural Languages:
PostgreSQL supports various procedural languages, including PL/pgSQL, PL/Tcl, PL/Perl, PL/Python, and more. Procedural languages allow users to create custom functions and stored procedures with complex logic directly within the database.
Example:
A developer can create a PL/pgSQL function to perform a specific task, such as calculating and returning statistical data or automating data processing tasks.

Data Types:
PostgreSQL offers a rich set of built-in data types, including numeric types, character types, date/time types, geometric types, JSON, arrays, and more. Additionally, users can define custom data types using the CREATE TYPE statement.
Example:
By using JSON data type, developers can store and query JSON documents natively within the database, facilitating document-oriented data storage.

In conclusion, PostgreSQL's database management system incorporates a wide range of components and background processes to ensure data integrity, performance, and reliability. The combination of these components and the flexibility provided by extensions, replication options, procedural languages, and data types makes PostgreSQL a versatile and powerful database solution for various applications and use cases.

Tablespaces:
Tablespaces in PostgreSQL allow users to control the physical location of database objects. By defining different tablespaces, data can be distributed across multiple storage devices or directories, providing flexibility in data storage management.
Example:
A PostgreSQL database with heavy read operations can benefit from storing frequently accessed tables on a fast SSD-based tablespace, while less critical tables or archival data can be stored on a larger but slower disk-based tablespace.

Full-Text Search:
PostgreSQL includes full-text search capabilities that enable efficient searching of text documents. It allows users to create indexes on text fields and perform advanced text search queries.
Example:
Developers can use the full-text search features to implement search functionality in applications, allowing users to search for specific keywords or phrases within large volumes of text data.

Event Triggers:
Event triggers in PostgreSQL allow users to associate custom PL/pgSQL functions with specific database events, such as DDL (Data Definition Language) events or database state changes. This enables users to automate specific actions in response to these events.
Example:
A database administrator can set up an event trigger to automatically log any changes made to a critical table or notify specific users when a table schema is altered.

Materialized Views:
Materialized views are precomputed and stored query results that can be refreshed periodically or on-demand. They are especially useful for speeding up complex queries and aggregations that are frequently used in applications.
Example:
By creating a materialized view that contains aggregated data from multiple tables, developers can significantly improve query performance, as the view contains precomputed results instead of calculating them on-the-fly.

Large Object (LOB) Support:
PostgreSQL provides support for large objects (BLOBs and CLOBs), allowing users to store and manage large binary or textual data, such as images, audio, or documents.
Example:
A content management system can use PostgreSQL's large object support to store and retrieve multimedia content associated with articles or blog posts.

Asynchronous Commits:
PostgreSQL offers the option of asynchronous commits, where transactions can be committed without waiting for the data to be written to disk. This feature can improve write performance, especially in scenarios with high concurrency and write-intensive workloads.
Example:
In applications with a high number of concurrent writes, asynchronous commits can help reduce the overall response time and improve the throughput of the system.

In summary, PostgreSQL's versatility lies in its extensive feature set, including various procedural languages, replication options, full-text search, event triggers, materialized views, and support for large objects. These components and features allow developers and administrators to design robust and efficient database solutions to meet a wide range of application requirements. PostgreSQL's continued development and active community ensure that it remains a reliable and popular choice for a diverse set of applications, from small-scale projects to large enterprise systems.

Foreign Servers and User Mappings:
PostgreSQL's Foreign Data Wrapper (FDW) functionality allows users to define foreign servers that represent remote databases or data sources. User mappings provide authentication credentials for accessing those foreign servers. This feature enables PostgreSQL to interact with data stored in various external systems seamlessly.
Example:
A PostgreSQL database can set up a foreign server representing a remote MySQL database. User mappings can be defined to provide the necessary authentication credentials to access the remote MySQL server. Queries executed on the PostgreSQL database can then transparently access and join data from the remote MySQL database using the foreign server.

JSONB and JSON Path Expressions:
PostgreSQL provides native support for JSONB (binary JSON) data type, allowing efficient storage and querying of JSON documents. Additionally, PostgreSQL supports JSON path expressions, making it easier to extract specific values from JSON data.
Example:
A web application storing user profiles as JSONB data can use JSON path expressions to retrieve specific attributes from the user profile JSON document, such as the user's name or email address.

Backup and Restore Tools:
PostgreSQL offers various tools for backup and restore operations to ensure data protection and disaster recovery. These tools include pg_dump, pg_dumpall, pg_restore, and support for point-in-time recovery (PITR).
Example:
Database administrators can use pg_dump to create logical backups of specific databases or tables, and pg_dumpall to create a full backup of all databases in a cluster. In case of data loss, pg_restore can be used to restore the backed-up data to a new database.

Roles and Privileges:
PostgreSQL supports role-based access control, allowing users to be assigned roles with specific privileges. Roles can represent individual users or groups of users, and privileges can be granted on databases, schemas, tables, and other database objects.
Example:
A PostgreSQL database can have roles such as "admin," "user," and "guest." The "admin" role might have full privileges on all database objects, while the "user" role has read and write privileges on specific tables, and the "guest" role only has read access to certain views.

Triggers:
PostgreSQL supports triggers, which are user-defined functions that automatically execute in response to specific database events, such as INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE operations on a table. Triggers allow users to enforce business rules or maintain referential integrity.
Example:
A trigger can be created to automatically update a "last_modified" timestamp column whenever a row is updated in a table.

Multi-Version Concurrency Control (MVCC):
MVCC is a core feature of PostgreSQL that ensures transactions do not interfere with each other. Each transaction operates on a snapshot of the data, allowing concurrent reads and writes without blocking.
Example:
Two transactions running concurrently can both read the same data from a table without interfering with each other. If one transaction modifies the data, the other transaction will see the original data until it commits, creating a consistent view.

Query Rewrite Rules:
PostgreSQL allows users to define query rewrite rules using the CREATE RULE statement. These rules allow users to modify or rewrite query plans to optimize performance or provide custom behavior.
Example:
A rule can be defined to rewrite specific queries to use a different index or join order for improved query execution speed.

In conclusion, PostgreSQL's rich feature set includes support for JSON data, foreign data access, backup and restore tools, role-based access control, triggers, MVCC, and query rewrite rules, among many others. These features empower developers and administrators to build sophisticated, scalable, and secure database applications tailored to their specific needs. The flexibility and robustness of PostgreSQL make it a popular choice for a wide range of applications, from small-scale web applications to large enterprise systems.

Replication Slots:
PostgreSQL's replication slots are a mechanism that allows replication clients (standby servers) to request and reserve WAL data from the primary server. Replication slots help ensure that standby servers do not fall too far behind the primary server, reducing the risk of replication lag and data loss.
Example:
A standby server requests a replication slot from the primary server. The primary server retains the WAL data until the standby server confirms that it has successfully applied the data. This ensures that the primary server doesn't discard WAL data required by the standby server for replication.

Table Constraints and Triggers:
PostgreSQL supports various types of constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE, CHECK) that ensure data integrity in tables. Triggers can also be used to enforce custom business rules and validations before or after specific database operations.
Example:
A table can have a unique constraint on a column to enforce that all values in that column must be unique. Additionally, a trigger can be created to prevent INSERTs or UPDATEs that violate certain business rules.

Foreign Key Constraints:
Foreign key constraints establish referential integrity between tables, ensuring that data in one table is always consistent with related data in another table.
Example:
If a table contains a foreign key referencing a primary key in another table, PostgreSQL enforces that any value in the foreign key column must exist as a primary key value in the referenced table.

Savepoints:
PostgreSQL supports savepoints, which allow transactions to be divided into smaller named subtransactions. Savepoints can be used to implement nested transactions or to roll back specific parts of a transaction without affecting the entire transaction.
Example:
Within a larger transaction, a savepoint can be set before executing a critical operation. If the operation fails, the transaction can be rolled back to the savepoint without rolling back the entire transaction.

Point-In-Time Recovery (PITR):
Point-In-Time Recovery is a PostgreSQL feature that allows users to restore a database to a specific point in time using the Write-Ahead Log (WAL) files.
Example:
In the event of data loss or accidental deletion, a PostgreSQL database can be restored to a specific time before the data loss occurred, ensuring data recovery to a precise state.

Parallel Query Execution:
PostgreSQL supports parallel query execution, allowing a single query to be split into smaller tasks and executed concurrently by multiple CPU cores, significantly improving query performance for large data sets.
Example:
A complex analytical query that scans a large table can be parallelized to leverage multiple CPU cores for faster data processing and query response.

pg_stat Activity Views:
PostgreSQL provides a set of views in the pg_stat schema that expose real-time statistics about database activity, transactions, locks, and more. These views offer valuable insights for monitoring and performance analysis.
Example:
Database administrators can use pg_stat_activity view to identify long-running queries, check the number of active connections, and monitor the state of client connections.

In conclusion, PostgreSQL's extensive feature set includes replication slots for replication management, various constraints and triggers for data integrity enforcement, foreign key constraints for maintaining referential integrity, savepoints for transaction management, PITR for data recovery, parallel query execution for performance optimization, and the pg_stat activity views for monitoring database activity. This rich array of features makes PostgreSQL a versatile and powerful database management system, suitable for a wide range of applications and use cases.

Two-Phase Commit:
PostgreSQL supports the Two-Phase Commit (2PC) protocol, which allows distributed transactions to achieve atomicity and consistency across multiple participating nodes.
Example:
In a distributed system with multiple databases, the Two-Phase Commit protocol ensures that either all the nodes commit the transaction successfully, or none of them commit, ensuring data consistency across the entire distributed system.

Listen/Notify:
PostgreSQL provides the LISTEN/NOTIFY mechanism for asynchronous communication between database sessions. It allows one session to send a notification to other sessions when specific events occur.
Example:
A web application can use the LISTEN/NOTIFY mechanism to inform connected clients about real-time updates, such as new messages, changes in data, or system events.

Common Table Expressions (CTEs):
Common Table Expressions are temporary result sets within a query that can be referenced multiple times in the same query. CTEs simplify complex queries and improve query readability and maintainability.
Example:
A CTE can be used to calculate intermediate results for a complex SQL query, and the final query can refer to the CTE multiple times without duplicating the code.

Window Functions:
Window functions are a powerful feature that allows performing calculations across a set of rows related to the current row, without grouping the data. Window functions can be used for ranking, aggregation, and analytical purposes.
Example:
A window function can be used to calculate a running total or moving average of data, without the need for a separate GROUP BY clause.

PL/pgSQL Debugger:
PostgreSQL includes a PL/pgSQL debugger, which is a tool that helps developers debug stored procedures and functions written in PL/pgSQL.
Example:
Developers can use the PL/pgSQL debugger to set breakpoints, step through the code, and inspect variable values during the execution of a stored procedure, helping to identify and fix issues in the code.

JSON Path Indexing:
PostgreSQL allows indexing of JSONB data using JSON path expressions. Indexing JSONB data can significantly speed up queries involving JSON operations.
Example:
By creating an index on a specific JSON path expression, queries that filter or search based on that path can be much faster.

Custom Background Workers:
PostgreSQL allows the creation of custom background workers, which are processes that run in the background and perform specific tasks.
Example:
A custom background worker can be created to perform periodic maintenance tasks or background data processing, providing custom functionality beyond the built-in background processes.

Certainly! Continuing from the previous response:

Asynchronous Streaming Replication:
PostgreSQL allows asynchronous streaming replication, where standby servers can lag behind the primary server without impacting the primary's performance. Asynchronous replication can be beneficial when low-latency read access on standby servers is not critical, and reducing primary server overhead is a priority.
Example:
In a scenario where the primary server handles heavy write traffic and the standby servers are primarily used for reporting or backup purposes, asynchronous replication can help balance the load and avoid performance bottlenecks on the primary.

PostGIS Extension:
PostGIS is a popular extension for PostgreSQL that adds support for geographic objects and spatial operations. It enables the storage, indexing, and querying of spatial data, making PostgreSQL a robust choice for location-based applications.
Example:
A mapping application can utilize PostGIS to store and query geographical data, such as points, lines, and polygons, for displaying maps and performing spatial analysis.

Partitioning:
PostgreSQL supports table partitioning, a technique that divides large tables into smaller, more manageable pieces called partitions. Each partition can be stored on different tablespaces or disks, providing improved query performance and data management.
Example:
For a table with historical data spanning several years, partitioning can be done based on time intervals (e.g., monthly partitions) to enhance query performance and facilitate data archiving.

Securing Data with Encryption:
PostgreSQL supports data encryption using various methods, including Transparent Data Encryption (TDE) and Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). Encryption ensures that data at rest and data in transit are protected from unauthorized access.
Example:
Sensitive information, such as user passwords or credit card numbers, can be encrypted to ensure data confidentiality.

Extension Ecosystem:
PostgreSQL's vibrant extension ecosystem includes a vast array of community-contributed extensions, providing additional functionalities and integrations. From specific data types to specialized data processing and integration with third-party systems, these extensions expand PostgreSQL's capabilities.
