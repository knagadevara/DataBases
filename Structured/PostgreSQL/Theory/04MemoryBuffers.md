# Memory in PostgreSQL

In PostgreSQL, efficient memory management is crucial for optimizing database performance and ensuring smooth query processing. Let's explore the key memory segments in PostgreSQL and their functionalities in detail:

Shared Buffer (shared_buffers):
-------------------------------
The Shared Buffer serves as a cache for frequently accessed data pages, reducing the need for disk reads and improving query performance. When a query requires data from a table or index, PostgreSQL checks the shared buffer first. If the data is present, it's retrieved from memory, which is much faster than fetching from disk. The Least Recently Used (LRU) algorithm is used to manage the shared buffer, replacing the least recently used data pages when new data needs to be cached.

        shared_buffers = 4GB

Work Memory (work_mem):
-----------------------
Work Memory is used for sorting and hash joins, as well as various internal operations in PostgreSQL. Sorting large result sets, executing hash joins, and performing certain internal tasks require temporary memory allocation. The amount of work memory needed for each query execution plan depends on the complexity of the operation.

        work_mem = 128MB

Maintenance Work Memory (maintenance_work_mem):
-----------------------------------------------
The Maintenance Work Memory is allocated for maintenance operations, such as VACUUM, ANALYZE, and index creation. These maintenance tasks may involve significant memory usage, especially during VACUUM operations, where data sorting and processing are necessary for space reclamation.

        maintenance_work_mem = 512MB

Temporary Memory (temp_buffers):
--------------------------------
Temporary Memory is utilized to store temporary data generated during various operations, such as sorting and hashing. When temporary tables are used in a session, PostgreSQL allocates temporary memory to store their data. It helps avoid unnecessary disk reads and speeds up temporary data processing.

        temp_buffers = 32MB

Connection Memory (max_connections):
------------------------------------
Connection Memory is critical for handling each client connection to the PostgreSQL server. When a client application connects to the database, a specific amount of memory is allocated to manage the session-related data and query execution for that connection. The total memory used by all connections impacts the overall memory consumption of the PostgreSQL server.

        max_connections = 100

Memory for Background Workers and Maintenance Tasks:
----------------------------------------------------
Background processes, such as autovacuum and background writer, also require memory for their operations. Autovacuum, in particular, performs tasks like VACUUM and ANALYZE, which may involve significant memory usage. The memory allocated to background processes is essential for their optimal performance and to avoid contention for system resources.
    
    - autovacuum_work_mem: This parameter controls the amount of memory allocated for Autovacuum operations. Autovacuum is responsible for reclaiming space, removing dead rows, and updating statistics, which can require memory for efficient execution

            autovacuum_work_mem = 256MB

    - bgwriter_lru_maxpages parameter: This parameter specifies the maximum number of dirty pages the background writer process can write per round. The background writer flushes dirty buffers from the shared buffer to disk, managing data durability and maintaining system performance.

            bgwriter_lru_maxpages = 1000

Memory for Query Execution (effective_cache_size):
---------------------------------------------------
The effective_cache_size parameter informs the PostgreSQL query planner about the size of the operating system's file system cache. This parameter helps the planner make better decisions when choosing query plans, considering that some data may already be cached in the operating system, leading to more accurate cost estimates and better plan selection.

        effective_cache_size = 4GB

Background Worker Memory (max_worker_processes and max_parallel_workers):
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
PostgreSQL allows background workers to perform tasks asynchronously. These workers may be involved in parallel query execution, background tasks, or custom extensions. The max_worker_processes parameter specifies the maximum number of background worker processes that PostgreSQL can create, and max_parallel_workers defines the maximum number of parallel workers that can be used in parallel query execution.

        max_worker_processes = 10
        max_parallel_workers = 4

Hash Table Memory (hash_mem_multiplier):
----------------------------------------
Hash-based operations, such as hash joins or hash aggregates, use a hash table to store intermediate data. The hash_mem_multiplier parameter controls the memory allocated to each hash table. Adequate memory for hash tables allows hash-based operations to perform efficiently and avoid excessive disk spills.

        hash_mem_multiplier = 0.05

JIT (Just-In-Time) Compilation Memory (jit_above_cost):
-------------------------------------------------------
PostgreSQL supports Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation, which translates parts of SQL queries into native machine code to improve execution speed for certain operations. The jit_above_cost parameter controls when JIT compilation is triggered. JIT compilation is employed when the cost of a query operation exceeds the jit_above_cost threshold.

        jit = on
        jit_above_cost = 100000

max_wal_size and wal_level:
---------------------------
These parameters control memory usage related to replication and Write-Ahead Log (WAL) management. Replication processes and the amount of data logged depend on these settings.

        max_wal_size = '1GB'
        wal_level = logical
