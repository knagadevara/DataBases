In PostgreSQL, several inbuilt/default databases serve specific purposes and play a crucial role in the database management system. These databases are created during the PostgreSQL installation and serve various administrative and system-related functions. Let's explore these crucial databases in-depth:

postgres Database: The postgres database is the default and primary administrative database in PostgreSQL. It is created automatically during the installation process and serves as the default connection database for the PostgreSQL superuser (typically named "postgres").

- Functionality:
    - Superuser Access: The postgres database is used by the database superuser to manage the PostgreSQL system, including creating and managing other databases, users, and permissions.
    - Default Connection Database: When a user connects to PostgreSQL without specifying a database name, the connection is established to the postgres database by default.
    - Layout: The postgres database does not contain any user data. Instead, it contains various system catalogs and system information required for the management and functioning of the PostgreSQL database system.
    - Configuration Example: To connect to the postgres database using the psql command-line utility, use the following command:

                $ psql -U postgres -d postgres

template0 and template1 Databases: The template0 and template1 databases are template databases provided by PostgreSQL. Template databases serve as templates for creating new databases in PostgreSQL. The template0 database is read-only and provides a clean, default template for new databases. The template1 database, on the other hand, can be modified and serves as a customizable template for new databases.

- Functionality:
    - Database Creation: When a new database is created in PostgreSQL, it is based on one of the template databases (template0 or template1).
    - Template for Customization: The template1 database can be customized to include user-defined schemas, objects, and data, allowing for personalized templates for new databases.
    - Layout: The template0 and template1 databases are regular PostgreSQL databases and have the same structure as any other user-created database. They contain various system catalogs and information.
    - Configuration Example: To create a new database based on the template1 database, use the following SQL command:

            CREATE DATABASE my_database TEMPLATE template1;

pg_catalog Database: The pg_catalog database is a system catalog database in PostgreSQL. It contains the system catalogs, which are collections of tables and views that store metadata about the database objects and system settings.

- Functionality: 
    - System Metadata: The pg_catalog database stores metadata about all the database objects, such as tables, columns, indexes, and constraints.
    - Access Control: The system catalogs determine access control permissions for various database objects.
    - Layout: The pg_catalog database contains numerous system tables and views, collectively referred to as system catalogs. These catalogs are essential for PostgreSQL's internal functioning and are not typically accessed directly by users.
    - Configuration Example: As a system database, users generally do not interact with the pg_catalog database directly. Instead, they interact with the individual objects and data through regular database connections and SQL queries.

Information Schema Database: The information_schema database is another system database in PostgreSQL. It is part of the SQL standard and provides standard views that allow users to access metadata about the database objects.
    - Functionality:
        - Standardized Metadata: The information_schema database provides standardized views that present information about database objects in a consistent and cross-database compatible manner.
        - Portability: By querying the information_schema views, users can write SQL queries that are more portable across different database systems that support the SQL standard.
        - Layout: The information_schema database contains a set of views, tables, and routines that present information about the database's structure, such as tables, columns, views, constraints, and more.
        - Configuration Example: To query the information_schema views to retrieve information about tables and columns, use SQL queries like the following:


            // Get a list of all tables in the current database
            SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_schema = 'public';

            // Get information about columns of a specific table
            SELECT column_name, data_type, is_nullable FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_name = 'my_table';
            
In conclusion, PostgreSQL's crucial inbuilt/default databases serve specific administrative and system-related purposes. The postgres database is the primary administrative database, while template0 and template1 databases serve as templates for creating new databases. The pg_catalog database stores system catalogs, and the information_schema database provides standardized metadata views. Understanding the roles and functionalities of these databases is essential for efficiently managing and interacting with PostgreSQL. While users typically work with regular databases created from the template1 database, they should be aware of the system databases and exercise caution when making changes directly to them. Proper management and configuration of these inbuilt databases ensure the stability, security, and optimal performance of the PostgreSQL database system.
